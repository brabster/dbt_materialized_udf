# Overview

Experimental repo for UDFs as DBT materializations. Adapter/dbt support is under discussion at https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/discussions/10395

Edit - added examples for UDAFs, stored procedures and stored procedure results. Comprehensive examples for UDFs, UDAFs, stored procedures and stored procedure results are in [`usage_example`](usage_example), see the [README](usage_example/README.md) for more information.

This repo supports [my blog post Materialized UDFs in a DBT World](https://tempered.works/posts/2024/02/19/materialized-udfs-in-a-dbt-world/).
